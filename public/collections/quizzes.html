            <p><b>4&rpar; favorite snack?</b></p>
            <p>This might be weird? But I really like dry cereal, especially fruit loops!!</p>

            <p>Nope, and I don't particularly want to be.</p>
            <p><b>6&rpar; favorite pokemon?</b></p>
            <p>Haunter! I also like rockruff and eevee!</p>
            <p><b>7&rpar; mario kart main?</b></p>
            <p>Rosalina!</p>

            <p><b>11&rpar; favorite shape?</b></p>
            <p>It's a pretty even tie between hearts and stars, but I think hearts win.</p>
            <p><b>12&rpar; do you believe in astrology?</b></p>
            <p>Sort of? I like astrology memes and generally won't make fun of people for believing in it, but it's not a big thing for me.</p>
            <p><b>13&rpar; do you believe in the occult?</b></p>
            <p>Also sort of?? I think the most honest answer is "yes, but with a grain of salt".</p>

            <p>VERY positive, I love vocaloid!!</p>

            <p>My favorite class from my high school years was Web Design, and this very website actually started as a project there! Though, technically, that was a college class. In terms of actual high school classes, my favorite was probably chemistry!</p>
            <p><b>18&rpar; what pokemon type would you be? dual types are allowed lol</b></p>
            <p>I'd probably be normal type 💀</p>
            <p><b>19&rpar; rei or asuka?</b></p>
            <p>I don't know them well enough to pick.</p>
            <p><b>20&rpar; favorite html tag?</b></p>
            <p>Either marquee or button!</p>
            <p><b>21&rpar; are you religious?</b></p>
            <p>Recently, yes! I'm not SUPER religious per se, but I've been looking into hellenic polytheism recently, and I'm really liking it!</p>
            <p><b>22&rpar; opinions on nightcore?</b></p>
            <p>Positive! I don't listen to it as much as I used to, but I enjoy it when I do, and I actually used to have a nightcore channel 😭</p>
            <p><b>23&rpar; did you go through any major phase? &lpar;emo, goth, weeaboo, etc&rpar;</b></p>
            <p>I honestly spend more time in phases than out of them. Emo and weeb are/were my most notable, and I had a pretty severe mermaid phase as a kid :'D</p>
            <p><b>24&rpar; are you good at drawing?</b></p>
            <p>I wouldn't say I'm <i>good</i> at it, <a id="color" href="/collections/drawings.html">but I do draw sometimes</a>!</p>
            <p><b>25&rpar; do you crack your joints?</b></p>
            <p>Yes, but I probably shouldn't 😭 I'm hypermobile and my physical therapist said that was NOT helping my health.</p>
            <p><b>26&rpar; do you read visual novels?</b></p>
            <p>Yes!! I like them, and even tried to make one once! ^^</p>
            <p><b>27&rpar; can you sew?</b></p>
            <p>Yes, but I'm not great at it. Most of my skills are applied to fixing my dog's toys.</p>
            <p><b>28&rpar; can you cook?</b></p>
            <p>I can bake better than I can cook, but as long as I have a recipe, I can probably do it.</p>
            <p><b>29&rpar; most expensive thing you've bought?</b></p>
            <p>A violin that I played exactly once 😭</p>
            <p><b>30&rpar; opinions on cosplay?</b></p>
            <p>Very positive! I'm very impressed by cosplayers, and I was actually a Sanders Sides cosplayer in 2020 ^^ I'm a little embarrassed by it, but still think of it fondly.</p>
            <p><b>31&rpar; what's your most hated band/musician?</b></p>
            <p>I don't really have one, I just don't listen to songs I don't like ^^;</p>
            <p><b>32&rpar; are you a dramatic person?</b></p>
            <p>I don't think of myself as one, but I CAN be, at times.</p>
            <p><b>33&rpar; what emoticon do you use most?</b></p>
            <p>Probably 😭 but idk</p>
            <p><b>34&rpar; can a miracle certainly occur?</b></p>
            <p>I think incredible and surprising things can absolutely happen, and it's up to the person it's happening to, to decide if it's a miracle or not.</p>
            <p><b>35&rpar; would you let a vampire suck ur blood?</b></p>
            <p>Strongly depends on whether or not they intend to turn/kill me, but assuming they don't, then I guess so?</p>
            <p><b>36&rpar; do you have a celebrity crush?</b></p>
            <p>Not currently, no.</p>
            <p><b>37&rpar; do you like snow?</b></p>
            <p>I like going to the mountain to play in the snow, but I wouldn't want it to snow at my house.</p>
            <p><b>38&rpar; were you really into greek mythology as a kid?</b></p>
            <p>Yes, and I'm actively falling back into it now.</p>
            <p><b>39&rpar; what are some things you could competently deliver a speech on?</b></p>
            <p>Um,, unprepared, nothing, but with proper notice given, songwriting and/or the importance of having a personal website!</p>
            <p><b>40&rpar; are you good at spelling?</b></p>
            <p>I'd like to think that I'm decent, but there are some words that ALWAYS mess me up.</p>
            <p><b>41&rpar; which touhou wud u fuk?</b></p>
            <p>I would not 🧍</p>
            <p><b>42&rpar; do you think there's going to be a robot takeover?</b></p>
            <p>I don't think so, and if there is, I don't think it'd be intentionally hostile, either.</p>
            <p><b>43&rpar; HAS SCIENCE GONE TOO FAR??!?!??!?!</b></p>
            <p>Too far in some places, not far enough in others.</p>
            <p><b>44&rpar; would you be an angel or devil?</b></p>
            <p>I say devil as a joke, but realistically, I have no idea.</p>

            <p>I've never tried it, but I don't think I would.</p>
            <p><b>63&rpar; are you a hopeless romantic?</b></p>
            <p>In theory, absolutely, but in practice, DEFINITELY not.</p>
            <p><b>64&rpar; which deadly sin best fits you?</b></p>
            <p>Probably sloth or gluttony.</p>
            <p><b>65&rpar; which of your physical features do you like the most?</b></p>
            <p>I don't know, probably my smile?</p>
            <p><b>66&rpar; are your ears pierced?</b></p>
            <p>Yep! Both lobes, and helix on the left.</p>
            <p><b>67&rpar; have you ever been in a physical fight?</b></p>
            <p>I took a karate class, but aside from that, nope.</p>
            <p><b>68&rpar; where do you buy your clothes?</b></p>
            <p>Wherever, I guess.</p>
            <p><b>69&rpar; where would you live if you could live anywhere?</b></p>
            <p>I honestly have no idea. I don't like this country (The USA) but I can't imagine living anywhere else.</p>
            <p><b>70&rpar; do believe in magic? or is it all a trick?</b></p>
            <p>I'm pretty sure I believe in it, but either way, I don't base my life around it.</p>
            <p><b>71&rpar; have you read umineko when they cry? you should!</b></p>

            <p><b>74&rpar; what would you want your name to be if you were not your current gender?</b></p>
            <p>I go by both Bailey and Jay, and my gender is kind of up in the air. I think if I was fully confident in calling myself a trans man (which I'm not), I'd lean more into the Jay name. If I were fully a girl, I'd probably stick with my birth name, which I will not be saying here because I said so.</p>
            <p><b>75&rpar; what were your first words?</b></p>
            <p>My first word was "mama", soooo nothing out of the ordinary, I suppose.</p>

            <p>Either 2019 or 2022.</p>
            <p><b>79&rpar; are you psychic?</b></p>
            <p>I used to think I had clairaudience, but I don't think I actually do 💀</p>
            <p><b>80&rpar; would you fuck a clone of yourself? you're not allowed to kill yourself.</b></p>
            <p>ABSOLUTELY NOT???? But I would probably try to be friends, maybe.</p>

            <p>Yes!</p>
            <p><b>87&rpar; would ever spend money on tf2 unusuals/csgo skins/gacha pulls/etc</b></p>
            <p>Eventually, if I had a lot of money, maybe, but as of now, nope! I haven't ever spent money on anything like that and I don't plan to.</p>
            <p><b>88&rpar; when do you usually go to bed?</b></p>
