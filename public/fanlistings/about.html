<h3 id="webmaster">About the webmaster!</h3>
<div class="paragraphs">
    <img id="pfp" src="img/pfp.png">
    <p>I'm Bailey, or Jay, and you can call me whatever you'd prefer! I'm also pretty receptive to silly nicknames, so I mean that. I use any pronouns, so call me what you'd like! I'm transmasc, but I'm still not that used to expressing it publicly, which is a big part of why I used the word "prince" while naming my collective!</p>
    <p>I've been coding my own websites since February of 2023, so I've been doing this for a while, but I took a while to discover and take interest in fanlistings. I started joining fanlistings in November of 2024, with the first one I ever joined being for <a href="https://fan.enamour.nu/deathnote" target="_blank">Death Note</a>! After seeing the fanlisting collectives of a few of my internet neighbors, I took even more interest, which brought me here!</p>

<h3 id="website">About the website!</h3>
<div class="paragraphs">
    <p>This site was created in February of 2025, for the purpose of holding all my joined fanlistings and the few I'd created. I did all the design and coding myself, and used 11ty to build it!</p>
    <p>This website has two URLS, <a href="https://pastelprince.netlify.app/" target="_blank">pastelprince.netlify.app</a> and <a href="https://lockheartlove.neocities.org/fanlistings/">lockheartlove.neocities.org/fanlistings</a>! Both URLs have the same content, but I wanted to do this for two reasons:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>I wanted to have a direct link, using the Pastel Prince name.</li>
        <li>I wanted to have my joined fanlistings linked on my main website.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>When applying for fanlistings, I give the link to my main Neocities website. I know that I should show the fanlistings I've joined on the website I linked, so I made the collective there. That said, I wanted to have a more dedicated URL for my collective, so this felt like the best solution! Please link to <b>https://pastelprince.netlify.app/</b> when linking back to this collective!</p>

<h3 id="fanlistings">About the fanlistings!</h3>
<div class="paragraphs">
    <p>All the forms I use in my fanlistings are created with <a href="https://tally.so" target="_blank">Tally</a>! This is partially because I already like and use them! (Not an ad but genuinely, I recommend them to everyone who tells me they need to make forms and I plan to get their pro plan when I can afford it.) Admittedly though, it's also partially because I have NO idea how to use PHP, and even if I did, the Enthusiast scripts don't recommend people to use them for new installations. Because the forms I <i>do</i> use simply collect the information and email it to me, I look over it, myself! Nothing here is automated, so updates are based purely on when I get around to them.</p>
    <p>I recently started using the <a href="https://fansfansfans.net/codegenerator/" target="_blank">fansfansfans code generator</a>, but a lot of my codes are made by me! When making and/or editing codes, I use <a href="https://medibangpaint.com/en/" target="_blank">Medibang Paint</a>! I generally favor 50x50 codes for listings and 75x50 codes for links out. You can look <a href="donated.html">here</a> to see other listings I've made codes for!</p>
    <p>Currently, my fanlistings only require a name and country, and allow the options of including your email and a website. You can choose whether or not to display your email, but if you don't choose, I'll default to keeping it hidden. While not all of my fanlistings are intended to join <a href="https://thefanlistings.org/" target="_blank">TFL (The Fanlistings Network)</a>, I figured these are standard enough questions and practices to use.</p>
