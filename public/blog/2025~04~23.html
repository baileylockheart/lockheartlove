<p>Hello hello! I've been super excited about something recently, so I wanted to yap about it on here :3</p>
<p>If you've been watching me for a while, or if you scroll back far enough that I'm concerned for your hands, you might remember this meme!</p>
<img src="/images/blog/everskies.jpeg" alt="me focusing on everskies over all my responsibilities and passions" width="100%">
<p>For context, Everskies is basically a glorified dressup game with a very odd focus on economy for something that kind of FEELS very indie web with highly customizable profiles and forums. It's aimed at kids but has a vast audience, and I was obsessed with it for a couple months last year. I was pulling 60 hour weeks, just grinding in that game to try and earn as much in-game currency as possible. I dropped a confusingly long essay as to how I did that, and kind of quit after that. I stopped playing, but I never deleted the app from my phone. I'd check in every now and then to claim log in rewards, and occasionally I'd play the mini games when I got bored, but for the most part, it was just taking up space. Until a couple days ago.</p>
<p>A couple days ago, I decided to try making a new avatar - again, it <i>is</i> a dressup game. I customized mine to look much more relevant to my current idea of what looks good, and my current aesthetic. It was nice, so I looked around the shop to get a few other items to add to it. I checked out the previously mentioned forums, and said hi to a few folks; I even sent a few of them gifts! I watched a few ads to earn some in-game currency, and participated in a few challenges. Next thing I know, I've been playing the game for seven hours straight, and I've earned myself a few subscribers. I even jokingly complained about this on Threads, saying that it was an accident, and yet, the first thing I did the next morning was log in to Everskies.</p>
<p>I've been back on Everskies for a little while now, and things already feel both identical to last time and insanely different. I'm not here because I followed my friends over to it, I'm here entirely because I want to be. I made a new profile layout, which I admittedly did last time, but this one just came out SO much better. Most surprisingly, though? I GOT MY FIRST COMMISSION.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, I never even opened commissions - I don't have a comm sheet and I'm pretty anxious about the idea of making one. I have yet to figure out prices and frankly, I didn't even plan to start commissions on Everskies, of all places. And yet. I saw someone posting in a club about layouts that they were looking for a layout based on a particular piece of media, which I recognized. They set the prices they wanted to pay themselves, and those prices were <i>very</i> generous considering what most people price layouts for. I figured it could be fun, so I made the layout and sent it to them. Not only did they like it, but they said they wouldn't use it until they could pay me (as Everskies has a rule regarding how old an account must be before you can send money to others).</p>
<p>I genuinely had a lot of fun with that, so I've actually been looking around the forums for people who are looking for layouts - I suppose in a way, this is more like freelancing than commissions? But I'm having enough fun with this that I'm genuinely considering making a comm sheet. Honestly, making mini websites (which is basically what my layouts are) for people sounds like a lot of fun!! Plus, I suppose toying around with this idea could lead to me having a better idea of what I'm supposed to do for if I ever open up commissions for <i>website</i> websites, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Anyways, the main point of all this is that I'm on Everskies again, and I'm enjoying it quite a bit ^^ If you play Everskies, my user is <a id="color" href="https://everskies.com/user/_Lockheart-2962006" target="_blank">_Lockheart</a> btw :3 Thanks for reading! ♡</p>
