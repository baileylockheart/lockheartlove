            <main>
<p>Hello hello! I haven't made a blog post in a bit, because I let myself start thinking they need to be essays, apparently. No more of that, this is just gonna be some yapping!</p>
<p>So, first off, and probably most importantly, I'm kind of back on YouTube?? I posted a video a few days ago, and I'm posting another one tomorrow! I don't think I'm going to be like those channels uploading every three days, but I am definitely hoping to post more often than once every three <i>months</i> üíÄ</p>
<p>Anyway, I've got a fan song in the works, and I'm thinking about making some other stuff too! I want my music to be for fun, rather than at this Important Required Thing‚Ñ¢. I also kinda want to make my alt channel into the channel I wanted as a kid, basically posting about anything I want? I'm working on figuring this stuff out, but yeah!</p>
<p>As for why I put magical girls in the title? I keep getting stuff about IRL Magical Girls on my tumblr dashboard, and I think the idea's pretty neat. I'm obviously not about to up and sign a contract, but I think it's cool in concept. I do think it's funny that this stuff started coming up on my dash at the same time as me getting Lolirock back in my YouTube reccomended all of a sudden, but yeah!</p>
<p>I think IRL Magical Girls / pop culture magic practitioners in general are pretty cool, and I kinda hate that people are so mean to them. Like, what are they doing to you that can't be fixed with a block button? They're not hurting anyone, so what's the issue? I know this all circles back to cringe culture and people not knowing how to mind their business, but it still irks me. Back on topic, though.</p>
<p>I like learning about things, and this is no different. I think the concept is super neat, and I wanna look more into it, just to see what's up. I like hearing people's stories!</p>
<p>All that said, I don't have much left to write. I'm having fun messing around with music again, I'm playing around with making videos, and I've found something new to learn about! I suppose this is less of a major post and more of a little update, but still. Thanks for reading! ‚ô°</p>
