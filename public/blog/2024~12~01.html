<p>Hello hello! First full day of the website being up, and I've already changed a lot!</p>
<p>I've been back to exploring webrings again, which led to me grabbing some virtual pets and graphics as well! It's been nice in that regard, and I enjoyed setting those up. I also moved the main website into a "public" folder, which will make it easier to move things over to Neocities once I can. Like I said in my last post, I do still intend to put this site on Neocities eventually. Netlify is nice, but it's currently just meant to hold it over. It'll be a pain to change it all when the time comes, but I'm willing to work through it (و •̀ ᴗ•́ )و</p>
<p>Anyways, in terms of actual changes to the site, I already got a lot done. However, that BARELY compares to the fact that I found out SO MUCH today???? I've had my Github account for a while now, and I mostly just used it to look around. When I started using it and launched my Github page (which is just silly portfolio thing), I already felt like I was learning a lot about how it worked. Now, though?? I'm actively losing my mind due to the amount of information flooding it.</p>
<p>And yes. That is hyperbole. BUT STILL. I found out yesterday that I could push from Github to Neocities, and that was already a shocker, but I just now found out about developer mode?? or whatever github.dev is called??? The browser-based editor thing that I just found out existed???? It made everything SO much easier when moving things over to the public folder, and it's so similar to VS Code that I have no issues navigating?! I feel kinda insane about all this. Like, I'm sure that it's barely scratching the surface, and I'm aware that I'm new to Github as a platform, but just. Like. Oh my god??? If I'd found out about this during school, I would've actually exploded, this is SO much better than awkwardly working with the notepad on my school chromebook.</p>
<p>So. Um. Anyways. Just from this, I can say with about 90% certainty that I enjoy this form of blogging much better than all the previous ones I tried. Now that the website's up and running, I'm excited to get things going! I'm happy to be an active webmaster again, so I hope to keep things running smoothly. I'll probably be doing pretty frequent updates while this dopamine spike is going, but even after that, I can see this being much more sustainable for me in the future. I'm excited to see where things go from here, and I hope you enjoy the journey. Thanks for reading! ♡</p>
