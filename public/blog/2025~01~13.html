            <main>
<p>Hello hello! This is my first post of the year, and also my first post as an 18-year-old!!</p>
<p>I'm now three days into 18, and I don't think it's really set in yet. Still though, there were some things I've been waiting to do for YEARS that I couldn't due to my age, and I've set a few of those in motion! One of the first things I did was set up a Ko-fi account, and as nice as it is, it IMMEDIATELY introduced a problem: I like it <i>too</i> much.</p>
<p>When setting it up, I figured that I could use Ko-fi for general donations, as well as posting anything non-music related. As of now, my page is new and relatively empty, but I've already moved my Notion templates over from my Gumroad account, since said Gumroad account was already kinda falling apart. (I don't know why, but it kept sending an error message whenever you went to my page??) If you wanna take a look at those Notion templates, here's a button :3</p>
<script type='text/javascript' src='https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/widget/Widget_2.js'></script><script type='text/javascript'>kofiwidget2.init('Check it out!', '#935adb', 'O5O518XBJA/shop');kofiwidget2.draw();</script> 
<p>All that said, through the process of creating my page, I realized something - I <i>really</i> like it. The layout, the general feel of it, the features available, all of it! It feels nice to navigate, I like the look of it, and it even seems to load pretty quickly. I like it a lot, and in fact, I can EASILY say I like it better than Patreon... Which is a problem.</p>
<p>I already have a Patreon, with over 30 posts on it. I wanted to share conent that wasn't ready for YouTube/Spotify yet (in my opinion), and I picked Patreon as a platform because there wasn't any other option for me at the time. I wasn't old enough for Ko-fi yet, and I wasn't sure what other platforms there even were! So, I made a Patreon, dumped a ton of content onto it, and called it a day. I still go and add things from time-to-time, but not on as regular a basis as I would've liked. I have tiers set up, but I had to struggle to figure out a way to set it up the way I wanted; my main goal was to share things, with money as a cherry on top, rather than the sole focus. I wanted a primarily public place to share content, with paying being a secondary option, which is why most of my Patreon content is actually available for free members.</p>
<p>Looking at Ko-fi in comparison, it feels like I should've just waited! While I found a way to get Patreon to do what I wanted it to do, Ko-fi seems like it was built for my exact purposes. It's hard to wrap my head around, but genuinely, the only thing stopping me from moving over everything from my Patreon is the fact that there are 30+ posts to look over and move. Obviously I wouldn't copy outdated updates and the general setup is different, but it's still a lot of stuff. The thought of it seems like an annoyance, even though I'm the only person it'd effect (as I don't have any followers on Patreon other than me on an alt account).</p>
<p>I don't know, I guess I have some stuff to think about. I genuinely like Ko-fi's layout much better than Patreon's, and it seems to fit my purposes better, but I'm not sure if I want to actually make the move. I'll probably be thinking it over, and I'll update here upon deciding! Thanks for reading! ♡</p>
