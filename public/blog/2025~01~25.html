<p>I feel like this might be a controversial take but I feel like everyone should have a website. Not the most controversial take on its own, but specifically, I feel like everyone should have a website REGARDLESS OF WHERE IT'S HOSTED OR IF THEY USED SITE BUILDERS. I see so many people putting the emphasis on coding it yourself, and while I agree in part, it's a pretty big barrier for people who are still new to the idea; I do NOT want that barrier stopping them from having their own spot on the internet!!</p>
<div id="mtw"><img class="static" src="/images/blog/mtw-static.gif"><img class="active" src="/images/blog/mtw.gif"></div>
<p>Now, don't get me wrong, I love hand-coded sites. I can ALWAYS see the love put into them and I know they'll last as long as the webmaster wants, regardless of how many social media platforms fall in that time. <a href="https://lockheartlove.neocities.org/" id="color" target="_blank">My own site</a> is hand-coded, so of course I love them! Coding it yourself is great for preserving your site and avoiding censorship! I also think it gives the maximum amount of control and creative freedom, and it's really fun once you get the hang of it. I will ALWAYS encourage people to code their own sites, and I'll point them in the direction of layout builders, free coding courses, and pre-built layouts if they're having trouble. It's worth the time and effort to get past that learning curve.</p>
<p>However. Not everyone has the time or the willingness to learn that skill, not yet... But they can probably start somewhere else, somewhere simpler, and to them, I say DO IT.</p>
<p>If you have a <a href="https://carrd.co/" id="color" target="_blank">carrd</a>/<a href="https://straw.page/" id="color" target="_blank">strawpage</a>/<a href="https://rentry.co/" id="color" target="_blank">rentry</a>, I will GLADLY look at it! In fact, I hope you have an 88x31 button available because if I like it, I will absolutely link it with all the other cool websites in my button wall, I DO NOT CARE THAT IT'S NOT ON NEOCITIES. I even anonymously gifted one of my mutuals a button for their strawpage because I desperately wanted to link it in my button wall, THAT'S how serious I am about this. I want to see YOUR site made how YOU want; if I'm looking at your art in a carrd gallery, I'm still looking at your art! I feel like making a website for yourself is something everyone should get to do, regardless of skill level.</p>
<p>I'll happily explore your <a href="https://www.wix.com/" id="color" target="_blank">wix</a>/<a href="https://wordpress.com/" id="color" target="_blank">wordpress</a>/<a href="https://www.blogger.com/" id="color" target="_blank">blogger</a> website! I'll enjoy my time looking at your <a href="https://sites.google.com/" id="color" target="_blank">google site</a>/<a href="https://www.canva.com/website-builder/" id="color" target="_blank">canva site</a>/<a href="https://mmm.page/" id="color" target="_blank">mmmpage</a>! And by the way, I will LOVE looking around your <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/themes/" id="color" target="_blank">custom tumblr theme</a>, especially if there are custom pages! I want to see what you make!</p>
<p>Yes, most site-builders are very limited compared to what could be accomplished by coding it yourself, but they're also <i>easier</i>. I know there's the saying that inconvenience is counter-culture, but in a way, I don't <i>want </i>having a website to be counter-culture. I kind of want it to be... Culture? If culture is a system of shared beliefs, values, and behaviors that define a group of people, and everyone having their own website could genuinely make the internet good again, then why <i>wouldn't </i>we want that?</p>
<p>I'm begging you to make a website, and beggars can't be choosers. I'm not asking you to hand-code a perfect website that's professional and responsive and filled with complex animations, I'm just asking you to make a website.</p>
<p>Don't wanna code? Then don't! There are tons of website builders you could use and I've actually linked to a bunch of them in this post. Wanna code but don't know where to start? <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" id="color" target="_blank">w3schools</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" id="color" target="_blank">MDN Web docs</a> are great, and <a href="https://mimo.org/" id="color" target="_blank">Mimo</a> and <a href="https://coddy.tech/" id="color" target="_blank">Coddy</a> are good if you want something more structured! Wanna code and know how to, but don't wanna deal with the initial layout? The <a href="https://goblin-heart.net/sadgrl/projects/layout-builder/" id="color" target="_blank">sadgrl</a> and <a href="https://petrapixel.neocities.org/coding/layout-generator" id="color" target="_blank">petrapixel</a> layout makers are both good, heavy on petrapixel if you want a repeatable layout. There are SO many ways to make a website, and I encourage you to do it in whatever way you want - the best way to do something is the way that you'll actually do, and that's never more true than it is with creative personal projects.</p>
<p>On a related note, I DO NOT care where you host your site, ESPECIALLY not if you hand-coded it. <a href="https://neocities.org/" id="color" target="_blank">Neocities</a> is popular, and I tend to talk about it most, but <a href="https://nekoweb.org/" id="color" target="_blank">Nekoweb</a> is cool too! <a href="https://netlify.com/" id="color" target="_blank">Netlify</a> is great if you want multiple sites, and <a href="https://pages.github.com/" id="color" target="_blank">Github Pages</a> is good for projects! <a href="https://leprd.space/" id="color" target="_blank">Leprd.space</a>, <a href="https://pages.gay/" id="color" target="_blank">pages.gay</a>, <a href="https://yay.boo/" id="color" target="_blank">yay.boo</a>, <a href="https://ichi.city/" id="color" target="_blank">ichi.city</a>, they all have different purposes and they're all valid choices! (And notably, they're free to use!) Hell, if you decided to throw the zip for your site on <a href="https://itch.io/" id="color" target="_blank">itch.io</a>, that's actually really cool and show me IMMEDIATELY. <small>(I mean it, my asks are open.)</small></p>
<p>Frankly, the only time I'm gonna care is if I know FOR A FACT that your webhost is ripping you off, in which case, it's more about me warning you than judging you.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna force someone who has no interest in making a website to make one, and similarly, I'm not gonna force someone who wants to make a website to do it "the right way". I want as many people as possible to have websites, both because I enjoy it and think it would make the internet a better place, and because I know SO many people would love it if they gave it a shot.</p>
<p>If you're on the fence about whether or not to make a website, try surfing the web to see the possibilities, or messing around in a simple site-builder and seeing if it's something you'd like. If you're not all that interested, I'm surprised you've read this far, but I'd ask you to reconsider - Do you hate censorship? Want more customization for your social profiles? Want something with more pizzazz than a linktree? A website can be a solution to all of those issues. </p>
<p>Most of all, if you want to make a website, do it. I don't care much about how, just <i>do it</i>. Make that website you've been wanting to make. It'll be worth it ♡</p>
