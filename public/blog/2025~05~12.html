<p>Hello hello! I'm trying to get more casual with this blog section again, since I slowly started making semi-essays and stopped updating as often because of it. So! Random brain itch time!</p>
<p>I've always been pretty bad at Minecraft. I got it on switch a few years back, and was able to play with a friend I had at the time (we fell out of contact, entirely my fault, I'm so sorry), but I was BAD. I mean, I understood the controls well enough, but I was bad at pretty much everything else. The actual mining and crafting, thinking up builds any more complicated than a box, fighting, even just finding my way back to our base - I literally had a sticky note with the coordinates on it because I kept getting lost.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to last year, and I used my birthday money to get it for PC, because I generally wasn't using my switch as much and didn't have Nintendo online anyways. I played with one of my best friends (still my best friend to this day), and she taught me a bit. She had a beautiful but partially-unfinished treehouse, and I helped with the roof. We spent a decent while mining for diamonds together, and she taught me which tools to use and what different things looked like. I felt a bit more confident after that, playing with her, so I started up a new world to try it out on my own. I was quickly confronted with the fact that I was still bad. Her world was already pretty developed, and she showed me where to go. Pretty much the only thing my old world had going for it was a chicken coop I made with a tutorial and paths I made via shovel so I could always find my way back. Starting from scratch was a nightmare. To add onto that, I was still absolutely horrible at dealing with anything hostile, to the point that I made my house an underground bunker so I wouldn't have to deal with anything on land - even then, I ended up getting so scared of random noises that I ended up setting the world to peaceful anyway. I played in that world maybe three times, and during one of those times I got so lost that I ended up taking several hours to get back.</p>
<p>So, why am I talking about this? Well, I recently have been thinking about video games in general. As I mentioned in my last post, I've been playing Everskies, which is basically a dress-up game. As I don't recall mentioning, I've also been on-and-off playing PonyTown, and while I haven't checked in in far too long, I love Genshin Impact and games that feel similar. However, someone on Everskies posted a picture of one of their minecraft builds, and it set off some weird little brain worm that I can't seem to shake.</p>
<p>On one hand, I feel like Minecraft just really isn't my kind of game. I like organizing things in enclosed spaces far more than building in open ones - my organized PonyTown house and empty teapot in Genshin can be testaments to this. On the other, I've been VERY interested in the idea of trying it out again, maybe starting with a new world, fresh, already set to peaceful for the sake of my sanity. It's a game, it's meant to be enjoyed, so why not just play in a way that'll be fun for me? As long as I keep track of my house's coordinates, or maybe make lots of smaller bases all over, I might be better this time...!</p>
<p>Or maybe I'm just delusional. I'll probably give this little plan a try tonight and see what happens. I'll make another post about it if all goes well :3 Thanks for reading! ♡</p>
