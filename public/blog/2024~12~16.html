            <main>
<p>Hello hello! I've been working on some other website-y projects, and my most recent one has me VERY excited!!</p>
<p>With most of my websites, I'm making things to show off other things. Places to drop links and talk about whatever I want. I've got this one, my puppy-related one, my art one, and SO many others, but overall, I tend to make things for me that can serve as entertainment at best for anyone else looking at them. Yes, I've made a handful of graphics, and I put some bits of code in my webmastery tools site, but nothing that isn't easy enough to come by or make on your own. HOWEVER.</p>
<p>Today, I've put together something that I think is actually pretty neat, and pretty useful! the site is <a id="color" href="https://carrd-icons.netlify.app/" target="_blank">carrd-icons.netlify.app</a> and it's basically a collection of carrd icons! Specifically, I'm setting them up to be something like a slightly-more-complicated fontawesome? I've been using carrd's icons for a while now, and I'm finally putting them together in a way that makes it much easier to add icons to your website! As of now, you've gotta download a file and such, which I find annoying and would like to fix, but the point still stands that IT WORKS!!!</p>
<p>It's a little messy, and I'm hoping to figure out how to make it even better, but I like it a lot! I've been sitting around and waiting for someone to make something like this, but if anyone did, I couldn't find it, so I did it instead! It's probably not very impressive to people who know more about this stuff than me, but for me, it's enough to be proud of it.</p>
<p>Anyways, I'm aware that this reads a bit like an ad, but honestly, I'm just so happy with it??? I like wasting my day away by tapping on keys and seeing what happens, but I actually feel like I did something productive today! Despite the heavy "click my link" tone I can practically feel myself using, I feel the need to tell someone about the fact that I did something I'm PROUD of, even if it's simple. Because of that, I wanted to share it here. Thanks for reading! ♡</p>
