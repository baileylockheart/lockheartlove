        <p>Hello and welcome to my shrine for EPIC: The Musical!</p>
        <p>Techinally speaking, I've known about EPIC for years. I saw it on TikTok and casually kept up with it. I watched auditions, watched the progress updates when they came across my FYP, and generally knew that "there's gonna be an Odysseus musical". I can't find the video for it now, since I deleted my old account, but I think I actually auditioned for Posedion??? I don't fully remember, but the point is, I've known about EPIC for a while.</p>
        <p>That said, for most of the time I've known about EPIC, I wasn't an active fan. The Ocean Saga was the only one I presaved, and I only listened to Ruthlessness. I occasionally got song snippets stuck in my head, but I didn't care enough to go watch it. In fact, as of writing this, the first time I listened to EPIC the whole way through was very recent! (I listened to EPIC for the first time on February 27, 2025.)</p>
        <video controls width="160px" style="float:right;padding: 0.4rem;">
            <source src="https://file.garden/ZrZSgsrYfQXsO7QH/videos/underworld.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
        <p>I find it funny that of all the things that could've prompted me to listen to EPIC, it was this Danny Motta short. The small snippet of "The Underworld" from this video made me shockingly emotional. Like, crying for half an hour and telling my therapist about it levels of emotional. Feeling very confused about that, I watched the full animatic for that he showed, and it both strengthened and softened the blow - now I wanted context.</p>
        <p>I looked up "epic the musical animatics", and found a playlist! I've linked said playlist in the related things area, I highly recommend it!! I love all the different ways the characters are drawn by different artists, and it generally gives a much clearer idea of what's happening than just listening, especially for the first time. After I watched the whole way through, I went back and rewatched my favorites. Then, I looked at other animatics of EPIC songs. Then, I looked at animatics of cut songs. Then, I went onto Spotify and listened to the whole soundtrack from the beginning, now picking up on references and melodies I hadn't connected the first time.</p>
        <p>It has NOT been that long since I first listened to EPIC (I'm writing this on March 5, 2025), but it's very rapidly taken over my life. I've written a couple self-indulgent fanfics, a few short songs, I'm looking into Greek mythology again, and I'm even considering <i>learning Greek</i>. When I say it's taken over, I mean it.</p>
        <p>EPIC has some really amazing music, and while said music varies in genre and mood, it's all awesome! The casting was perfect in my opinion, and some of the characters are voiced by artists I already knew and liked before I heard them in EPIC (e.g Telemachus, voiced by MICO, and Aphrodite, voiced by Janani K. Jha.) They bring life to the characters, and I can't imagine any other voices fitting them better! Additionally, a lot of them will fully embody their characters for skits, either as promotion for EPIC or just for themselves, and either way, it's always very fun to watch!</p>
        <video controls width="160px" style="float:left;padding: 0.5rem;">
            <source src="https://file.garden/ZrZSgsrYfQXsO7QH/videos/ocean-harms.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
        <p>Also, this is somewhat unrelated to the musical, but I also think the man behind it, Jorge Rivera-Herrans (aka Jay, aka Mr. Jalapeno) generally has some fun vibes! I like watching his videos, and I would even if I wasn't all that invested in the musical. Plus, I find him kind of relatable, in a sense? Mostly via his reactions to things and the levels of silliness he can get up to. Honestly, he's quite inspiring to me as well! Seeing how happy he was while working on EPIC makes me happy, too! His talent and passion are extremely admirable in my opinion, and I'm actually more motivated to record than I have been in a while, entirely because of him. Back to the point, though.</p>
        <p>EPIC: The Musical is definitely one of my favorite musicals now, and while I can't say for sure as I'm currently fixated on it, I think it might be my all-time favorite! It's genuinely amazing in so many ways - the music, the characterization, the way it builds upon and changes the original story, the cast, the fanbase, everything! I really love EPIC: The Musical, and I think you will, too! &#9825;</p>
