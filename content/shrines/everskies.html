        <p>Hello and welcome to my shrine for Everskies!</p>
        <p>Everskies is,, a game? It's technically a dress-up game, with both a mobile app and a website. I'm active on both, as it's cross-platform, which is really nice! The reason I hesitate to call it a game is because it's more like a social media platform, in a sense. It's filled with forums, which I love, and it has a pretty heavy focus on buying and selling things, which I love notably less. It's strange to say the least, but I still like it enough that I'm making a shrine about it, y'know?</p>
        <p>I originally started playing in 2022, though I was quickly turned off by how inherently it relied on currency and talking to strangers in order to run, so I uninstalled the app. Notably though, I didn't bother to delete the account. It sat there for a while, untouched but otherwise intact.</p>
        <p>It remained that way until last year, when several of my friends on Threads all joined at the same time. I remembered it, so I logged back in, and my understanding of it suddenly shifted. Interacting with my friends, building up currency via minigames so I can buy them gifts, browsing through different forums, it was fun! I realized you can earn currency extremely fast by watching ads, which led to me spending an absurd amount of time with the app open, just playing ads - I was spending nearly 60 hours a week this way, basically watching ads for as long as I was awake.</p>
        <p>I've always known I'm oddly susceptible to rewarded ads for some reason, so I spent quite a while in that cycle. Even when all of those friends moved on from the game, I was still doing this for a while. Even after I mostly lost interest, I kept it installed so I could occasionally log in to watch a few ads and claim the login rewards. Still though, I <i>did</i> lose interest for a while, so I had effectively abandoned the game for another year.</p>
        <p>I'm not even sure what drew me back this time - I wanted to change up my character for no real reason, so I popped back in to do so. Next thing I know, I've been playing for hours and I got several new followers! Not long later, and all of a sudden, I was getting my first ever layout commissions, essentially making small websites for people!</p>
        <p>Making layouts is SUPER fun for me, and technically, I've been doing it for a while! I have a codepen account that I used to make and share simple website layouts a while back, and I've added some Everskies layouts to it as well! I don't put my commissions there, for the sake of ~exclusivity~ or whatever, but I'm thinking of making some more premade layouts, and maybe making some snippets to add to other ones!</p>
        <p>Now, technically I have <a href="/blog/2025~04~23">a whole blog post</a> about how this all happened, so I don't need to rehash it here. The point is, Everskies, to me, went from a nothing social app to an addictive ad-watching cycle to the source of my first ever commissions, all in the span of three-ish years. It's crazy to think about! I went from uninstalling it without a thought to opening it before I even check the time, and I genuinely really like it now!</p>
        <p>It is odd, though. The environment can border on toxic at times, and it feels strange relative to most socials. It doesn't really feel like social media, but it doesn't really feel like a forum, and it still somehow barely feels like a game?? I know it's technically all of those things, which might be part of why I still can't really put my finger on what it <i>feels</i> like. I know I like it, and I know a lot of people hate it, and I can't even argue with them about it - not because they're unreasonable, but because I understand where they're coming from. Everskies is flawed but fun in my opinion, and everyone's entitled to their own.</p>
        <p>I'm making this shrine as a sort of extension to the blog post, just wanting to talk about something I'm interested in for a bit longer. A (mildly) proofread yap section, I suppose. If you've read this far into it, I really appreciate it! Also, if you happen to have Everskies and want to say hi, I've linked my account :3 Thanks for reading! &#9825;</p>
