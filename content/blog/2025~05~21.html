<p>Hello hello! In my last blog post, I said I wanted to give Minecraft another try, and that I'd update once I did! This is that update :3</p>
<p>This post is honestly gonna be pretty short, because the answer is simple: I LOVE MINECRAFT NOW. I don't know how or why it happened, but I got sucked in and it won't let go. I have pets in the game, an in-game journal, lots of little builds scattered around, and it's just SO much fun.</p>
<p>I joined <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/lockheartlove/" target="_blank">Planet Minecraft</a> and even made my own website about Minecraft!!</p>

<p>It's got basically everything relevant in it, I show off some of my builds, the texture packs I use, and even one that I made!! I seriously got so excited about minecraft that a shrine wouldn't cut it, I needed to make a whole entire website ðŸ˜­</p>
<p>Anyways, as I said, this post is just a short update to my previous post, so that's all I've really got for you for now. It's honestly nice to make little update posts and not feel like I have to put a whole essay, so I might make more short posts like this moving forward? I'm not sure. Anyways though, thanks for reading! â™¡</p>
