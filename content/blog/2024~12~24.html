<p>Hello hello! This is it! After nearly a month, I've finally made the move to Neocities!!</p>
<p>Finally, <i>finally</i>, I get to have my homepage be a Neocities link!! Ever since I first came up with the idea for this site, I knew I wanted it to be on Neocities, and now it finally is! I got my site to a place I wanted it, and I made the move. I'm proud of myself, actually! I was planning to hold off until I could move my other site to a .com domain, but then I realized that I didn't need to wait. In fact, waiting would've probably been more detrimental in the long run?? So, I made the switch, and it's pretty good so far! Good, but not as great as anticipated.</p>
<p>I'm honestly a bit nervous about this switch, since I got used to my site being on Netlify. Because of that, as well as the fear of broken links, I kept the site up on its previous domain as well I'm still putting in the time to actually make sure I've fixed up said links, but the idea still stands. I've got to update my info in a few webrings, but aside from that, everything seems to be going smoothly!</p>
<p>I'm both relieved and not to finally have it up here. Like I said, I got used to it being on Netlify! I honestly felt a little special? Like, by having my site be hand-coded and silly, but hosted somewhere other than THE place for reclaiming the web, I was doing something good? Which is silly, considering that I wasn't even paying for a domain (which I'm still planning to do for my other site, by the way)! Having it on Neocities now is nice, and I'm hoping to one, find some cool people to be internet neighbors with, and two, spend even more time customizing my site to my liking! I love Neocities as a platform, and I have a feeling that the only real reason I'm anxious about all this is because it was a big change in a short-ish time frame.</p>
<p>Knowing that doesn't take the pit out of my stomach. Now, I can't really say I regret moving my site over - I literally <i>just</i> did it, and I kept the Netlify version up! In fact, said Netlify version will continue getting updates in time with the Neocities one. It's just... My browser still jumps to the Netlify URL when I begin to type in the site name. That's obvious, as again, this change is new. But that's what my brain feels like.I'm used to that link, it autofills in my head when I think about it. I think I found some weird sense of pride in being hosted on not-neocities, and having my site follow link be a github repository instead of a neocities profile. It's silly, really, but I don't know how to change it.</p>
<p>Something that does bring an equally silly amount of comfort, is knowing that Neocities is managed on Netlify. In essence, even after moving from Netlify to Neocities, I'm still technically on Netlify??? I don't know if this makes sense to anyone but me, but the point is that it makes me feel better.</p>

<p>Anyways, this was a bit of a ramble. As I'm sure you can tell, I'm both excited and anxious, which is a wonderfully terrible combination that has me writing a blog post at midnight. Still though, I'm glad I made this change, and I'm grateful that I have the ability to make cool things. I'm also grateful that I have the ability to yap into my little internet brain dump, which now resides at two different domains, and no one can tell me to stop!! Thanks for reading! â™¡</p>
