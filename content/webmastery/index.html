    <p>Knowing how quickly I go from calm, with a text editor available, to planning and executing a small site of some sort, I'm making this whole thing (mostly) for my own sake. </p>
    <p>I wanted something to make the beginning steps a little easier on me, as well as something that I can bookmark in my browser, and that I could share!</p>
    <p>No credit or link back needed if you use any of this stuff, but here's a button if you want to ^-^</p>
