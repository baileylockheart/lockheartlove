                        <p>Welcome to my first and third personal website! I know that sounds weird, but in essence, while I really enjoy making websites, I struggle a bit when it comes to making <i>personal</i> ones. I had one that I used for quite a while, but I did so while pretending to be someone else. I had another meant solely for my music, but because of that, it became a bit less personal in the process. I also tend to feel like I need to create content, rather than express myself and my interests, which is something I'm hoping to break out of with this!</p>

                        <p>Anyways, that was some stuff about this site, I suppose? But now for some stuff about me, the person behind the screen!<br>As I said before, I'm Bailey! I'm 17 as of writing this, and my brain is a bit of a disorganized clump of interests! (This is a good thing, don't worry.) As of now, I have two "primary" interests: Webmastery(? Maybe I just mean web design? I don't really care about programming or anything on the back end) and music!</p>
                        <img id="lessgo" src="/images/lessgo.jpg" alt="HEYYYY, website stuff! I'm procrastinating. let's go.">
                        <p>As I'm sure you can tell, I do enjoy making my little static websites quite a bit! I want to learn more about front-end web design, since I think I could get pretty good at it if I put the time into it. I'd actually consider myself relatively new to the internet, as I only <i>really</i> started looking at it in about 2019. And, when I say "really started looking at it", I don't mean that that's when I started making websites. That's actually the age that I started using the internet for anything other than school purposes, and that includes simply looking at YouTube videos and playing browser games! It actually wasn't until February of 2023 that I even considered making a website on my own, as opposed to just playing around with carrds and the color options on tumblr. Even once I did that, it took a couple months for me to get my first website up and running - that website now being <a id="color" href="https://baileylockheart.neocities.org" target="_blank">baileylockheart.neocities.org</a>, a site made for my music.</p>
                        <p>And about that music! I've been a songwriter for years now, for longer than I've been on the internet, and I've loved music even longer. I can't really get all emotional and say that music is my outlet or the only true way I can express myself, since that's not exactly it. Rather, it's a way for me to expand on ideas and utilize my creativity to make it into something I (and hopefully others) can enjoy. In that way, it's kind of similar to what I'm aiming for with this website! Generally, I've always wanted my songs to explain or express an idea, some common to the point of cliche and some painfully specific, in a way that fills a gap in the music that <i>I</i> enjoy listening to.</p>
                        <p>That said, while I've always loved music, it took me a while to wrap my head around the idea of independant musicians, and even longer to understand the concept of music production. I finally got that last concept into my head during the summer of 2023, and published <a id="color" href="https://snd.click/lxxz" target="_blank">my first EP</a> a mere two weeks after school started once again. To this day (I say as if it's been a decade), I still can't tell if it's mixed/mastered terribly, or if I'm being judgemental because I'm the one who did it.</p>

                        <p>As for what I'm doing now, I'm kind of just existing! I graduated with my associate's, and now I'm not really sure of what's next. For now, I'm trying to get used to being creative again, which is a bit of an adjustment! For now, this little website is a bit of an internet brain dump, which will hopefully be fun!</p>
